## Loading and preprocessing the data

```r
url <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
download.file(url, "activity.zip")
unzip("activity.zip")
```


```r
df <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

The following code calculates returns the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. 


```r
library(dplyr)
df2 <- df %>% group_by(date) %>% summarize(dailySum = sum(steps, na.rm=FALSE))

meanStep <- mean(df2$dailySum, na.rm=TRUE)
medianStep <- median(df2$dailySum, na.rm=TRUE)

paste("The mean no. of step taken per day is:", round(meanStep), sep=" ")
```

```
## [1] "The mean no. of step taken per day is: 10766"
```

```r
paste("The median no. of step taken per day is:", round(medianStep), sep=" ")
```

```
## [1] "The median no. of step taken per day is: 10765"
```

The following code produces a histogram of the daily sum of steps taken.


```r
hist(df2$dailySum, xlab="Daily No. of Steps", main="")
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

The following code produces and plots the averge number of steps taken at each time interval.


```r
df3 <- df %>% group_by(interval) %>% summarize(avg = mean(steps,na.rm=TRUE))
with(df3, plot(interval, avg, xlab="interval", ylab="Average No. of Steps", type = "l"))
```

![](PA1_template_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

The following code determines the time interval with the highest number of steps.


```r
maxAvg<- max(df3$avg)
maxInt <- df3$interval[df3$avg==maxAvg]

paste("The interval with the max. no. of step is:", maxInt, sep =" ")
```

```
## [1] "The interval with the max. no. of step is: 835"
```

## Imputing missing values

In the dataset, there are a few days with the values of steps missing, represented as "NA". The missing values are replaced by the mean values of steps calculated from other days. 


```r
meanInt <- df %>% group_by(interval) %>% summarize(avg = mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE))
df4 <- df
for (i in 1:nrow(df4)) {
  if (is.na(df4$steps[i])) {
    df4$steps[i] <- meanInt$avg[meanInt$interval==df4$interval[i]]
  }
}

df41 <- df4 %>% group_by(date) %>% summarize(sumDaily= sum(steps,na.rm=TRUE))

mean2 <- mean(df41$sumDaily, na.rm=TRUE)
median2 <- median(df41$sumDaily, na.rm=TRUE)

hist(df41$sumDaily, xlab="Daily No. of Steps", main="")
```

![](PA1_template_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->



```r
meanStep2 <- mean(df41$sumDaily, na.rm=TRUE)
medianStep2 <- median(df41$sumDaily, na.rm=TRUE)
paste("The mean no. of step taken per day is:", round(meanStep2), sep=" ")
```

```
## [1] "The mean no. of step taken per day is: 10766"
```

```r
paste("The median no. of step taken per day is:", round(medianStep2), sep=" ")
```

```
## [1] "The median no. of step taken per day is: 10766"
```


```r
compare <- data.frame(Original=c(meanStep,medianStep), Modified=c(meanStep2,medianStep2),row.names=c("Mean","Median"))
compare
```

```
##        Original Modified
## Mean   10766.19 10766.19
## Median 10765.00 10766.19
```

The mean and median values of the modified dataset are very close or equal to that of the unmodified data set.

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?


```r
df5 <- df %>% mutate(dayofweek = weekdays(as.Date(as.character(date)))) %>% mutate(weekday = ifelse(dayofweek == "Saturday"|dayofweek=="Sunday", "No", "Yes"))
df51 <- df5 %>% group_by(weekday, interval) %>% summarize(avg = mean(steps,na.rm=TRUE))

weekday <- df51[df51$weekday=="Yes",]
weekend <- df51[df51$weekday=="No",]

par(mfrow=c(2,1))
with(weekday, plot(interval,avg, xlab="", ylab="Average No. of Steps", ylim=c(0,250),main="Weekday", type ="l"))
with(weekend, plot(interval,avg, xlab="Interval", ylab="Average No. of Steps", ylim=c(0,250), main="Weekend", type="l"))
```

The two graphs show there are difference in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends. Activity starts earlier during weekday. Overall, the activities in weekends are more evenly spreaded over the entire day.
